# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a machine learning model to predict loan approvals based on applicant details.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes features like:
- Gender, Marital Status, Education
- ApplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Credit_History
- Property_Area, etc.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)

## 📈 Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

## 🎯 Goal
To assist financial institutions in predicting loan approvals, minimizing risk, and automating the approval process.
